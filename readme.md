Furthermore, In my experience, the frontend design is essential too. so please make a look at the following!

### Example
##### Update many documents

In the same way I was able to update one document with `updateOne()`, I can update multiple documents with `updateMany()`.

    filter = eq("student_id", 10001);
    updateResult = gradesCollection.updateMany(filter, updateOperation);
    System.out.println("\n=> Updating all the documents with {\"student_id\":10001}.");
    System.out.println(updateResult);


In this example, I'm using the same `updateOperation` as earlier, so I'm creating a new one element array `comments` in these 10 documents.

Here is the output:

    => Updating all the documents with {"student_id":10001}.

AcknowledgedUpdateResult{matchedCount=10, modifiedCount=10, upsertedId=null}

##### The findOneAndUpdate method

Finally, we have one last very useful method available in the MongoDB Java Driver: `findOneAndUpdate()`.

> In most web application, when a user update something, he wants to see
> this update reflected in his web page. Without the
> `findOneAndUpdate()` method, you would have to run an update operation
> and then fetch the document with a find operation to make sure you are
> printing the latest version of this object in the web page.

The `findOneAndUpdate()` method allow you to combine these two operations in one.
